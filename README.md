# 🧠 Algorithm Notebook (Raw Practice)

This repository is **not** a tutorial, **not** a structured course, and **not** a collection of optimized solutions.

It’s simply my **public practice log** — a place where I dump `.txt` files with algorithm exercises.  
No order. No categories. No formatting standards. Just **pure problem-solving practice**, written like in school notebooks.

## Purpose

I’m training **without autocomplete, without IDE assistance, and without relying on intelligent tools** — writing algorithms manually to strengthen raw logical thinking.

This repo exists so I can:

- 🗂️ Archive my attempts instead of losing them.
- 📈 Track my progress over time.
- 🔁 Repeat problems without shortcuts.
- 🧪 Make mistakes openly and improve through iteration.

## What to Expect

- `.txt` files with algorithm exercises — some correct, some messy.
- Mixed formats: pseudocode, Java, Python, or whatever I’m using that day.
- No consistent naming.
- No explanations.
- No guarantees of quality.

Maybe in the future I’ll organize it or turn it into something useful.  
**For now, this is not meant to be valuable to others — only to myself.**

If you somehow find this inspiring and want to practice the same way, feel free.  
**Just don’t expect perfection — this is training, not presentation.** 💪
